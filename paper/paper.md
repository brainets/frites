# Summary

The field of cognitive computational neuroscience addresses open questions regarding
the complex relation between cognitive functions and the dynamic coordination of neural
activity over large-scale and hierarchical brain networks. State-of-the-art approaches
involve the characterization of brain regions and inter-areal interactions that participate
in cognitive processes [@Battaglia:2020]. More precisely, the study of cognitive
brain networks underlies linking brain data to experimental variables, such as sensory
stimuli or behavioral responses.

Information-based measures, such as information theoretic quantities, machine-learning models or measures of distances, currently provide ideal tools for quantifying the coupling between brain signals, and the link between brain network’s activity and task variables. Nevertheless, progress is limited by the lack of neuroinformatics tools that combine methods for the estimate of information-based measures from neural data and the assessment of their statistical relevance at the population level. `Frites` provides such an integrated framework and it is optimally developed for the discovery of cognitive brain networks from multi-channel neurophysiological datasets.

# Statement of need

[`Frites`](https://brainets.github.io/frites) (_Framework for Information
Theoretical analysis of Electrophysiological data and Statistics_) is a pure Python
package for cognitive (task-related) brain network inference, which combines in a single framework information-based analyses of neurophysiological data and group-level statistical inference.

`Frites` is equipped with a set of information theoretic tools for the analysis of interactions between brain signals and their relation with experimental task-related variables. More precisely, this package can be used to study the relation between local brain activity, cross-frequency coupling [@Combrisson:2020] and inter-areal functional connectivity (FC) with experimental variables (i.e., cognitive tasks). For what concerns FC, the toolbox allows the estimate of dynamic (i.e., time-resolve), undirected (e.g., mutual information) and directed (e.g., Granger causality) functional connectivity (FC) on a single-trial basis [@Brovelli:2015]. The core functions for information measures exploit a `NumPy` tensor-based implementation of the Gaussian Copula Mutual-Information [@Ince:2017]. Nevertheless, the definition of custom estimators, such as kernel methods [@Wollstadt:2019] and [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) cross-validated classifiers [@Pedregosa:2011], is also supported.

The package integrates a non-parametric permutation-based statistical framework to perform group-level inferences on non-negative measures of information. The toolbox includes different methods that cope with multiple-comparison correction problems, such as test- and cluster-wise p-value corrections. The implemented framework supports both fixed- and random-effect models to adapt to inter-individuals and inter-sessions variability [@Combrisson:2021]. 

`Frites` is optimally designed for the analysis of continuous and multi-channel neurophysiological data, encompassing recordings with either uniform spatial sampling (e.g., M/EEG data) and spatially sparse intracranial recordings, such as intracranial EEG or Local Field Potentials (LFPs). The package supports standard [`NumPy`](https://numpy.org/) array inputs [@Harris:2020], objects from the [`MNE-Python`](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html)  software [@Gramfort:2013], but also multi-dimensional labelled  [`Xarray`](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/) objects [@Hoyer:2017].

In order to facilitate automated and efficient usage, `Frites` provides a set of high-level workflows that integrate several analysis steps from information-based estimation to network-level statistical inference.

Since several computations implemented in the workflows, such as permutation tests, are computationally demanding, `Frites` natively supports parallel processing using the [`Joblib`](https://joblib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package. In addition, some functions can further be accelerated using the [`Numba`](http://numba.pydata.org/) compiler [@Lam:2015] as an optional dependency. Programming optimizations
and external dependencies allow to investigate large-scale datasets in a reasonable
time.
