Define temporal windows
=======================

This example illustrates how to define temporal windows that can then be used
to compute, for example, the dynamic functional connectivity. In this example,
we show how to define either custom windows or sliding windows with different
sizes.


.. code-block:: default

    import numpy as np

    from frites.utils import define_windows, plot_windows

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.collections import PatchCollection
    from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle








Simulate data
-------------

Let's start by creating a simple sinusoide with a time vector. Then, to
define windows we are going to use the function
:func:`frites.utils.define_windows` and also
:func:`frites.utils.plot_windows` for plotting.


.. code-block:: default


    n_pts = 1000
    period = .2  # 200ms period
    times = np.linspace(-1, 1.5, n_pts, endpoint=True)
    x = np.sin(2 * np.pi * (1. / period) * times)








Manually define windows
-----------------------

The first feature we illustrate here, is to define windows manually which
means, based on the time vector, where each window should start and finish.


.. code-block:: default


    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))

    # by default, if you don't provide any input, the full time window is going to
    # be considered
    win = define_windows(times)[0]
    plt.subplot(311)
    plot_windows(times, win, x, title='No input = full time window')

    # however, you can also specify where each window start and finish. Here, we
    # define a simple unique window between [-.5, .5]
    win = define_windows(times, windows=[-.5, .5])[0]
    plt.subplot(312)
    plot_windows(times, win, x, title='Unique window [-.5, .5]')

    # but you can also specify multiple windows
    win = define_windows(times, windows=[[-.75, -.25], [.25, .75]])[0]
    plt.subplot(313)
    plot_windows(times, win, x, title='Multiple windows manually defined')
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()

Define sliding windows
----------------------

You can also define sliding windows which can be controlled through four
parameters :

* `slwin_len` = window length
* `slwin_start` = starting time point
* `slwin_stop` = stopping time point
* `slwin_step` = step time between consecutive windows


.. code-block:: default


    # sphinx_gallery_thumbnail_number = 2
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))

    # if you only gives the length, consecutive windows are defined from first to
    # last time point
    win = define_windows(times, slwin_len=.2)[0]
    plt.subplot(411)
    plot_windows(times, win, x, title='200ms consecutive windows')

    # but you can also change where the sliding window start
    win = define_windows(times, slwin_len=.2, slwin_start=-.5)[0]
    plt.subplot(412)
    plot_windows(times, win, x, title='Start sliding windows from -.5s')

    # in addition, you can also define where it stop
    win = define_windows(times, slwin_len=.2, slwin_start=-.5, slwin_stop=.52)[0]
    plt.subplot(413)
    plot_windows(times, win, x,
                 title='Start sliding windows from -.5s and finish at .5s')

    # finally, we can control the "distance" between each consecutive window. For
    # example, if the length is 200ms and a distance of 150ms, it is equivalent to
    # a 25% overlap
    win = define_windows(times, slwin_len=.2, slwin_start=-.75, slwin_stop=1,
                         slwin_step=.15)[0]
    plt.subplot(414)
    plot_windows(times, win, x,
                 title='Sliding windows from [-.75, 1]s with 25% overlap')

    plt.tight_layout()

    plt.show()
