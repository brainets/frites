"""Simulate data for testing Frites functions.

This submodule contains a collection of functions to simulate data in order to
test Frites functions and workflows. There are several ways to simulate data :

1. **Using an auto-regressive model :** this method can be used to simulate
   a task-related brain network (i.e with local activity and information flow
   modulated by a stimulus)
2. **Using gaussian variables :** in that case, the generated data are feature
   specific but only at the node level
